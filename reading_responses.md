# Reading Responses
"Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly." Writing responses is an opportunity to clarify and consolidate your thinking on the assigned reading.

## Logistics
* Materials (mostly papers) we'd like you to write reading responses for will be marked as "**PREREAD** for next class" in the [schedule](http://cs426.cloud/schedule.shtml) page.
* Write your reading responses in the google doc shared with you ("<NetID> CS426 Reading Responses"; check "Shared with me" on your google drive).
* Responses are due before class time for which the reading is assigned.

## Parameters
* Write **200-300 words** (ball park, not a hard limit) in reponse to the assigned reading. This should be _your_ critical review or commentary of the paper or the system.
* **Structure and content.**
  * Your response should not be a mere summary, though it is often helpful to start with a 1~2 sentence distillation of the main point or contribution of the paper / system.
  * Prioritize clarity over lavishness of prose, i.e., no need to wordsmith and focus on your arguments.
  * We are not looking for a particular right "answer" or "view" of the paper or system, but rather whether your stance is compelling and well supported.
* Some general prompts around which you can formulate your response, but you are not obligated to answer each of these prompts.
  * What are the authors' arguments / observations / insights / tradeoffs?
  * What worked well about the system? What would be the disadvantages?
  * Do you buy the authors' arguments? Why or why not?
  * Compare with one other system: consider systems that precede or come after the paper, what's similar? what's different? Why did the systems make different choices? To find related systems, it's often useful to look at the Related Work section of a paper or find on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) later papers that cite the one at hand.
  * Some reading response assignments have paper-specific prompts or questions that might also guide your reading.
* **Grading:** the goal of this assignment is to ensure you have done your reading and get a chance for independent thinking and writing. This will be closer to participation grade unless you submit something entirely incoherent or made-up.
