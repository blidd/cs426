What a journey. Implementing Raft was everything promised, maybe more.
At the end of the day, the lab was a rewarding experience and really put
my programming abilities to the test; definitely one of the most complex
programs I have implemented solo in my young computer science career.

The first major challenge was understanding at a deep level the nuances
of the Raft algorithm. When I didn't fully understand something and wrote
the code based on the wording of the spec and the student guide, I almost
always ran into issues and bugs later on. An example would be with log
matching and appending the right entries. 

This was also a great lab for exercising my concurrent programming skills
that I built up over the course of the fall in Operating Systems and in
labs 0 and 1. Again, reasoning about interleaving was difficult without
a strong understanding of the algorithm, and the reasoning behind the 
instructions outlined in Figure 2 of the paper.

All in all, I enjoyed doing this lab but am definitely glad it is behind
me now. Time to enjoy the rest of my last semester at Yale :)
