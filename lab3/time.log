I discussed my solution with: Tony Xu

This problem set was quite straightforward. I had worked pretty extensively
with Docker previously so Part A was not an issue for me. However I was 
running into minor problems with my Kubernetes deployment that required some
research to resolve. For Part C, I had thought about the issues around managing
client connections so it wasn't a challenge for me to re-factor my code to
allow connection pooling. The assignment is also overall very manageable
relative to the previous one, no real complaints or major obstacles.
