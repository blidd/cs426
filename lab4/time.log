We enjoyed working on this lab. The topic was interesting and relevant 
to readings and lecture discussions we have engaged with throughout the
semester. Getting our hands dirty with a rudimentary implementation of
a distributed cache reinforced many of the concepts concerning the 
design and practical issues of sharding and storing data. A challenge 
was coordinating our work and ultimately making sure everything lined
up properly in the integration tests. This was excellent practice for
our final project.
