I discussed my solution with: Tony Xu, Seun Omonije

The hardest part of the problem set for me was the parallelization of
PredRange scans for StripedStringSet. I was having a bit of a hard time
deciding what concurrency tools to use. I initially considered using
WaitGroups, however that would require using buffered channels because
if the channel was unbuffered, the main thread would need to wait on
the channel and not the goroutines in the WaitGroup. Using buffered
channels is an issue because I don't know how many matches we will find
in the set. An upper bound would be the size of the entire set, but
that seemed like a lot of unnecessary overhead. So I ended up waiting
on an unbuffered channel in the main thread and having the parallelized
goroutines send a message into the channel after they finish scanning
their respective stripes. Once the main thread receives the "done"
message from each goroutine, it can return a list of all matches.
